## About The Project

Traditional commerce lacks sustainable alternatives, leading to excessive unnecessary consumption and waste. Our society needs an innovative and sustainable solution/platform to empower individuals to exchange goods or items, promoting a more eco-friendly, community-oriented, conscious and responsible lifestyle.

Objectives:

- The primary objective of BarterX is to provide a user-friendly platform that facilitates meaningful exchanges of goods and services.
- Encourage users to swap items they no longer need, promoting a culture of sustainability and reducing unnecessary waste.
- Encourage regular engagement through features like one to one chats, and user proposals.
- Who says you need to know all the trends by name to shop? If you see something you like, take a picture, upload and start trading.


Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
